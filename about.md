Security girl in Microsoft with experience more than 13 years in security. She spends all her time working closely with developers and architects to make security built in from design level. She is a big supporter of making security as culture and shifting security to the left thru DevOps. Victoria believes that empowering developers and architects in security tasks by helping with education will increase security level without increasing additional workload.

During her free time, she deep dives into Cloud security, development, identity and access management. And of course, she doesn't forget about running, hiking and motorcycles, which are the biggest passion after security.
